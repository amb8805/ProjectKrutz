          <h2>Project Information</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Mobile applications are typically updated more frequently than traditional desktop applications, with many applications being updated several times a month. These updates occur for a variety of reasons, including bug fixes, required updates for new phone hardware, or feature additions. While the intention is for each release to make the software better, they unfortunately often cause more harm than good.</p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The goal of this project is to gather application information from as many Android application package (APK) files as possible in order to examine correlations between various quality metrics and security characteristics of the applications. In particular, some of the metrics we looked at are adherence to coding standards, file size, over- and underpermissions, and any defects or security vulnerabilities that may exist.</p>
          <p>Currently, there is no existing data set such as the one we have produced as a result of this project. We hope that such a data set will be valuable towards future research.</p>
